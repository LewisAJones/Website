    "text": "I am a computational palaeobiologist investigating the drivers of biodiversity patterns across a range of temporal and spatial scales. My research primarily focuses on the co-evolution of life and the environment, and evaluating the influence of data incompleteness on our perceptions of the geological past. To do so, I integrate a range of interdisciplinary tools and sources of information, such as ecological niche modelling, fossil occurrence data, and palaeoclimatic models.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Mapas Lab at the University of Vigo, where I study the constraints and drivers of spatial biodiversity patterns in the fossil record. If you are interested in joining our lab, please feel free to get in contact. We will periodically advertise opportunities for student projects and we welcome researchers wanting to do a short stay.\n\nResearch Interests\n\n\nAnalytical Palaeobiology, Macroecology and Biodiversity, Fossil Record Bias, Corals and Reef Ecosystems, Palaeoclimate, Ecological Niche Modelling, and R Programming"
