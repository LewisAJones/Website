    "text": "R Packages\n\npalaeoverse\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe palaeoverse R package is a community-driven toolkit to support the preparation and exploration of palaeobiological data. The package provides a suite of auxiliary functions, is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN. palaeoverse has three core principles: (1) streamline data preparation and exploration; (2) enhance code readability; and (3) improve reproducibility of results. It is my hope that over time, palaeoverse will be adopted and developed by the community, with contributors and users from across the globe.\n\n\n\n\nrphylopic\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rphylopic R package allows users to add silhouettes of organisms from the PhyloPic website to plots generated in base R and ggplot2. The package was originally developed and maintained by Scott Chamberlain. From ver. 1.0.0, the package is now developed and maintained by myself and William Gearty from the Palaeoverse team. The package is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nrmacrostrat\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rmacrostrat R package allows users to interfaces with the Macrostrat database to access and retrieve a variety of geological, palaeontological, and economic data directly to the R environment. The package provides straightforward functionality for accessing and retrieving a variety of geological, paleontological, and economic data hosted by Macrostrat. The package is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nsepkoski\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe sepkoski R package is a light and easy solution to access Sepkoski’s fossil marine animal genera compendium. The package provides access to the raw dataset, a dataset with intervals standardised to the International Geological Time Scale, and plotting functionality for reproducing Sepkoski’s Phanerozoic curve. The package is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN."
