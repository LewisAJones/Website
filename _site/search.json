    "text": "Research\n\nElucidating Diversity Dynamics in Marine Tropical Hotspots\n\n\nLife on Earth is extraordinarily diverse. More than eight million species are recognised today, and yet they represent a tiny fragment of the total number of species that have ever existed. Today, this richness is unevenly distributed across the Earth‚Äôs surface with biodiversity hotspots‚Äîareas of particularly high species richness‚Äîa macroecological phenomenon of the biosphere. Within the marine realm, biodiversity is concentrated in the Indo-Australian Archipelago, where corals and other reef groups achieve their greatest species richness. Although such spatial disparity in biodiversity has been recognised for centuries, we still do not understand the formation and drivers of such biodiversity hotspots, which is critical to forecasting species‚Äô responses to ongoing global change.\n\nThe fossil record tells us that biodiversity hotspots have waxed and waned through time, with the existence of at least four marine biodiversity hotspots throughout the Cenozoic‚Äîthe last 66 million years. But what is the evolutionary history of these biodiversity hotspots? And are there any general rules governing the emergence, maintenance, and decline of these macroecological phenomena? In the EDiTH project, I am addressing these questions by integrating the rich fossil record of corals with ecological and Earth System modelling to reconstruct their macroecological and macroevolutionary history.\n\n\n\n\nMesophotic and turbid reefs as key ecosystems for the future\n\n\nShallow warm-water coral reef ecosystems are experiencing rapid ecological declines in response to anthropogenic climate change. However, reefs found in ‚Äòmarginal‚Äô settings, including deep mesophotic and shallow turbid mesophotic habitats are currently displaying higher resilience to on-going global climatic change. If such marginal habitats provide suitable conditions to escape the impacts of climate change, then they may have the potential to act as critical ecological refugia. In the MURKY project, I am collaborating with a large international team to investigate whether these marginal habitats provided a long-term ecological refugia for corals throughout past climatic perturbations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeoverse\n\n\nSince the development of large palaeontological datasets from the 1970s onwards, palaeontologists have increasingly adopted computational approaches to address questions about the history of life on Earth. Today, programming is an integral part of palaeobiological research with code commonly used to access, clean, analyse, and visualise data. In the Palaeoverse project, I work with an international group of Early Career Researchers to bring the palaeobiology community together to share resources, reach agreed standards, and improve reproducibility in palaeobiological research."

    "text": "Macroecology & Biodiversity | Corals & Reef Ecosystems | Palaeoclimate | Fossil Record Bias | R\n\n\n\nI am a Computational Palaeobiologist examining the macroecological and macroevolutionary history of reef-building organisms through the integration of interdisciplinary tools and diverse sources of information, such as ecological modelling, Earth System modelling, and fossil and extant occurrence datasets. An additional theme of my research is evaluating the influence of data incompleteness on our perceptions of the geological past, such as biodiversity trends. I also work on developing open-source software tools and resources for the palaeobiology community with the aim of improving research reproducibility in the field.\nI am currently a NERC Independent Research Fellow at Univeristy College London, where I am focusing on reconstructing the evolutionary history of Cenozoic marine biodiversity hotspots and testing their long-term drivers.\n\nWhat‚Äôs new?\n\n2024\n\nI‚Äôve moved back to London!

    "text": "R Packages\n\npalaeoverse\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe palaeoverse R package is a community-driven toolkit to support the preparation and exploration of palaeobiological data. The package provides a suite of auxiliary functions, is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN. palaeoverse has three core principles: (1) streamline data preparation and exploration; (2) enhance code readability; and (3) improve reproducibility of results. It is my hope that over time, palaeoverse will be adopted and developed by the community, with contributors and users from across the globe.\n\n\n\n\nrphylopic\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rphylopic R package allows users to add silhouettes of organisms from the PhyloPic website to plots generated in base R and ggplot2. The package was originally developed and maintained by Scott Chamberlain. From ver. 1.0.0, the package is now developed and maintained by myself and William Gearty from the Palaeoverse team. The package is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nrmacrostrat\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rmacrostrat R package allows users to interfaces with the Macrostrat database to access and retrieve a variety of geological, palaeontological, and economic data directly to the R environment. The package provides straightforward functionality for accessing and retrieving a variety of geological, paleontological, and economic data hosted by Macrostrat. The package is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nsepkoski\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe sepkoski R package is a light and easy solution to access Sepkoski‚Äôs fossil marine animal genera compendium. The package provides access to the raw dataset, a dataset with intervals standardised to the International Geological Time Scale, and plotting functionality for reproducing Sepkoski‚Äôs Phanerozoic curve. The package is open-source, and freely available from the CRAN."
